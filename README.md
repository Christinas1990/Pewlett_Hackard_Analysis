# Summary 
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

133,776 people will be retiring

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

since only 1940 people are eligible for the program, there are not enough people for the next generation. It is good to advice the company to 
enlarge the training program to fill the positions that are going to be empty after the "Silver Tsunami"
